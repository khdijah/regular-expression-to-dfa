There are many flaws in this code.....sorry !!!
You will have to follow at least following things ...


1. This code is written in C , this may not work in different machines. I've tried this on ubuntu. This     works fine on ubuntu.

2. I'm using graphics.h for drawing circles and lines. To make the things work on your ubuntu machine you will have to follow this link :  https://askubuntu.com/questions/525051/how-do-i-use-graphics-h-in-ubuntu.

3. Compile your app using following command  

    c++ dfa.c -o output -lgraph

4. Run the app

      ./output

5. If you follow those steps , it will work on ubuntu machine.


Apart from all these things , there are many issues with this code . I couldn't fix those because of time and other things.

Still I hope it works in your ways .....
